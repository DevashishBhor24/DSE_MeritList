# DSE Merit List Generator 

Python Scripts to scrap the data from Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education's (MSBTE) Result Website and Generating dataset for further data analysis and college allotment prediction.
The generated dataset had several metrics and properties generated by the program like State Level General Merit Number, Branch Merit Number, Group Merit Number, etc. Then it is cleansed, organized and visualized in suitable way to analyze the data and predict the college allotment on the basis of merit.  


## Tech Stack

**Python, HTTP Requests, Web Scraping, BeautifulSoup, Pandas** 



## Demo
(Due to the web scraping, very next year MSBTE changed their result generation method to human verification. Hence it is no longer applicable but yet I have captured the moment demonstrating how the execution did happened)
